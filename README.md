# 🏦 Banking-Churn-SQL-Analysis (SQL Project)

##  Project Overview

This project aims to analyse bank customer data to uncover insights about financial behaviour, credit utilization, income patterns, and risk assessment. Instead of focusing on churn or retention, the project emphasizes:
The Banking and Financial Analytics domain revolves around using data-driven insights to optimize banking operations, enhance customer experience, and mitigate risks. Banks collect vast amounts of data from customer transactions, credit histories, and financial behaviour, which are analysed to make informed business decisions.
In this domain, various analytical techniques are used to understand customer segmentation, assess credit risk, detect fraud, and improve financial product offerings. The primary goal is to enhance financial stability while maximizing customer retention and profitability.
